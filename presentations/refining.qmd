```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
install.packages("baseballr")
```

Loading in standard stats:
```{r}
baseball_ref_24 <- read_csv("https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2024-standard-batting.shtml#players_standard_batting")
```

Using fangraphs as centralized source for the stats on savant and traditional stats:
```{r}
all_stats <- read_csv("~/Documents/GitHub/jour479x_fall_2024/presentations/Fangraphs stats - Sheet1.csv") |>
  mutate(ab_hr = AB/HR) 
```
```{r}
top_n(all_stats, 10, EV)
```
```{r}
top_n(all_stats, 10, maxEV)
```

These top 10s give me a general idea of each of the savant stats. My next step is to join these stats with the traditional season stats so I can then figure out what the correlation is between the two.
