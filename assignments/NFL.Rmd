Reflection:

Much to the displeasure of many Washington fans, the Commanders haven't frequently targeted star pass-catcher Terry McLaurin. This has been particularly apparent in the first halves of their games.

McLaurin's received just seven first-half targets through Washington's three games this year. It's a notable drop from that span last season, where the Commanders targeted the receiver 12 times. This isn't a new gripe, though â€” McLaurin had just six targets in the opening half of his teams first three games in 2022.

```{r}
pbp_2024 |>
  filter(!is.na(receiver)) |>
  group_by(receiver) |>
  summarize(targets = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(targets))
```
