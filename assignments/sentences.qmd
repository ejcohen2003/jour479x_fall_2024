The Prarie View Lady Panthers led all of NCAA women's soccer in shot on goal percentage in 2023, putting seven out of 10 attempts on target — that's a good thing, right?

The Panthers ultimately won just three of their 16 games, though, as their percentage was inflated by a lack of shot attempts. In turn, it begs the question of if missing target more frequently is actually an alright thing, as a more aggressive approach — rather than Prarie View's seemingly conservative mindset — could lead to a better success rate when those shots are on target.
